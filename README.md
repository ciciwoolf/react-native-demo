# React Native Exploration Project

This repository showcases my exploration and learning journey with React Native development using the Expo framework. Built with modern React Native practices, this project demonstrates cross-platform mobile application development capabilities.

## Technology Stack

- **React Native** with Expo
- **TypeScript** for type safety
- **File-based routing** with Expo Router
- **ESLint** for code quality

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (latest LTS version recommended)
- npm or yarn package manager

### Installation & Setup

1. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Start the development server**

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

3. **Run the application**

   Choose your preferred platform:

   - **iOS Simulator** (requires Xcode on macOS)
   - **Android Emulator** (requires Android Studio)
   - **Expo Go** mobile app for quick testing
   - **Web browser** for web development

## Project Structure

The application uses Expo Router's file-based routing system. Core application logic is organized within the `app/` directory, with reusable components in the `components/` folder.

## Development Notes

This project serves as a practical exploration of React Native development patterns, including:

- Cross-platform component design
- Navigation implementation
- TypeScript integration
- Modern React hooks and patterns
